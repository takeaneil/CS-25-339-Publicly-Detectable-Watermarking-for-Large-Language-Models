## *Short Project Description*
The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others who will 
follow in your footsteps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the development of this project. 

| Folder | Description |
|---|---|
| Documentation |  all documentation the project team has created to describe the architecture, design, installation, and configuration of the project |
| Notes and Research | Relevant helpful information to understand the tools and techniques used in the project |
| Project Deliverables | Folder that contains final pdf versions of all Fall and Spring Major Deliverables |
| Status Reports | Project management documentation - weekly reports, milestones, etc. |
| scr | Source code - create as many subdirectories as needed |
